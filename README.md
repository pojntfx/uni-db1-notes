# Uni DB1 Notes

Personal notes for the DB1 course at HdM Stuttgart. DB1 is an introduction to SQL and PL/SQL using the proprietary Oracle database.

If you intend on learning how to work with databases, please refrain from using the proprietary Oracle database. Choose a superior alternative, such as PostgreSQL or MariaDB instead. [Free Software, Free Society](https://www.fsf.org/about/what-is-free-software)!
